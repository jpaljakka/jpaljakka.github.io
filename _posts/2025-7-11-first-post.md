# Welcome to my blog!

This my first post on this blog. I will be writing about various topics related to software development, technology, and life in general. I have no plans to make this daily blog, but more like writing when I have something to say or share. 

Sometimes my posts might be more technical, and sometimes they might be more general about life. I have small politician in me, so I might write about world politics too but mostly in view of technological advancements. Thah being said, AI might be one of the topics I will write about. I've been playing around with AI alot past 6 months, and I have some thoughts about it.

Anyways, this is just a short introduction post to get things started.
