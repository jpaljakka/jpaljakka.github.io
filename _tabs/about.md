# Who am I?

I'm a software engineer with a background in healthcare. I ended up in Healthcare field when i was 18 and i worked in that field for around 10 years. Until i was 29 years old i worked in healthcare, i started as a nurse and ended up working as a nurse manager. I always had a passion for technology and computers, and I wanted to do something more technical. I got my first computer at the age of 7 and had own computer since, before i got into coding i enjoyed alot of tinkering with hardware and cyber security was my big interest for a longtime. 

In 2019 I decided to change my career path and started to study software engineering, i got into business college for learning coding and ended up getting my first job before graduation. I have been working as a software engineer for a five years now. Today I work as a full stack developer, mainly focusing on backend development. I have experience in various programming languages and frameworks, including but not limited to Typescript and C#. 

> Recent year i've been enjoying side projects with Rust and C/C++, not specialist yet but learning and enjoying the process. I'm looking forward to move more low-level programming in the future.
